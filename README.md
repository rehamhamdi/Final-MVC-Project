#  Student Management System 

This project is a **full-stack web application** built using **ASP.NET Core MVC** with **Entity Framework Core** for database management.  
It was developed during my **ITI Summer Training** as my graduation project in the **.NET Web Development** track.

It provides complete **CRUD operations** for managing students, courses, departments, enrollments, instructors, office assignments, and attendance — with **registration, authentication, authorization, validation, and a responsive UI**.
